### DATA MUNGING
The original census dataset is a CSV (comma separated values) file containing 7,581 records and 11 
features. Each of its feature had a string datatype. Also, missing values, blank text, inconsistent values, 
and multiplicity of the same categorical values were noticed in some features. Steps taken to clean 
the data set (feature-by-feature) can be found in a [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/Beegie01/Census-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Census_data_cleaning.ipynb) solely dedicated to data 
cleaning.<br><br>
